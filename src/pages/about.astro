          I was part of the team that developed the Halstack design system that
          is used internally by DXC. Now, I am working on the maintenance and
          development of a suite of web apps in charge of the deployment of
          other applications and their infrastructure in AWS. This task requires
          knowledge of AWS infrastructure, Jenkins pipelines, and Terraform.

          I consider myself a person who likes to learn and work horizontally
          with all the team members. I really like to feel that my work as a
          software engineer really helps people in their daily lives.
