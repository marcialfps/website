        🧍🏽 I am Marcial, a software engineer and a change agent from Lanzarote,
        in the archipielago of the Canary Islands, Spain.
      </p>
      <p>
        💻 I was part of the team that developed the Halstack design system that
        is used internally by DXC. Now, I am working on the maintenance and
        development of a suite of web apps in charge of the deployment of other
        applications and their infrastructure in AWS. This task requires
        knowledge of AWS infrastructure, Jenkins pipelines, and Terraform.
      </p>

        🧑🏽 I consider myself a person who likes to learn and work horizontally
        with all the team members. I really like to feel that my work as a
        software engineer really helps people in their daily lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        🫱🏼‍🫲🏽 I have been volunteer in multiple organizations and projects since
        2014. I am the technical secretary of Prensa Juvenil Canaria NGO and the
        coordinator of the organization with European Youth Press. I have
        organized different projects that are related with youth participation.
