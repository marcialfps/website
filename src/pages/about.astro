      <p>
        I was part of the team that developed the Halstack design system that is
        used internally by DXC. Now, I am working on the maintenance and
        development of a suite of web apps in charge of the deployment of other
        applications and their infrastructure in AWS. This task requires
        knowledge of AWS infrastructure, Jenkins pipelines, and Terraform.

        I consider myself a person who likes to learn and work horizontally with
        all the team members. I really like to feel that my work as a software
        engineer really helps people in their daily lives.
